# How to contribute!

We welcome folks who would like to use our code and extend it! Beginners can start by forking the project and reaching out to listener at hackergram dot org for a sample configuration.
Once you have a change you would like to see in the main branch, please submit a pull request to a new patch branch in this repository and we will test and merge if the change meets the project guidelines.
